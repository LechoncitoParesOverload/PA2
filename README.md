# Normalization Problem
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Mathematically the process can be expressed as taking variable "X" and subtracting it from its mean and dividing it with the standard deviation.

Stated in the problem we need to generate random variables and integrate it into the inside of the array aswell as rearranging it to a 5x5 square. We can use the functions ".mean()" for element-wise mean and ".std()" for element-wise standard deviation. Saving the final array in a .npy file called "X_normalized.npy" and outputting the normalized array
